        <h2 id = "plants">Plants</h2>
        <p>Plants are on the the bottom of the food chain (or          food web). The only thing before that is the sun (in most         cases). Otherwise, they are <b>carnivorus</b> plants.           That means they eat small creatures. Most plants have          leaves to soak up sunlight and roots to get water and           nutrients. Since plants can't move, they use defences           like thorns and poison (and stinging hairs for insects)         to get away from predators. Plants make their own food,         so they are <b>producers.</b></p>

        <p>There is a lot of info on plants on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
        <h2 id = "animal">Animals</h2>
        <p>An animal has to have at<i> least </i> one of these          senses to be an animal. They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sight
            <li>Hearing
            <li>Touch
            <li>Taste
            <li>Smell
        </ul>
        <p>But of course, some plants can smell, but they are           not animals. Better watch out for that! Anyways,             animals do not do <b>photosynthesis</b> (making sunlight         into food). At least, those that we know of. They eat           plants, that means they are <b>consumers</b>. Animals           that eat other animals are called <b>secondary consumers</b>.</p>
        <h3>Cats, Dogs, and Foxes: Related</h3>
        <p>Red foxes <i>(vulpes vulpes)</i> and other types of foxes are sort of a mix of cats and dogs, mostly cats. and I am not saying this because I like cats more than dogs. It's true. But how? Before we say this, let's say this: the dogs <i>might</i> have been wolves. The cats and dogs (wolves) might have grown together. just a guess. Don;t take it seriously.</p>
        <h3>Dogs and Cats: Why Fight?</h3>
        <p>Dogs and cats fight because they have different body language, or, opposite body language. for example, a wag from a dog means it's happy but a wag from a cat means it's angry.</p>

        <h2 id = "underlife">Underwater Life</h2>
         <p>Ok. We know that plants take sunlight, animals eat           plants  animals eat other animals and so forth. But what         would happen if the sun was gone? In the deep, deep, sea         , sunlight can't reach. How do the animals survive?               Scientists tackled this problem. They figured out that          there are certain molecules that plants use, and                animals eat the plants, and so on.</p>

        <h2 id = "pollution">Pollution</h2>
        <p>Cars. Plastic. Fossil fuels. Do you care about these         ? These are examples of <b>pollution</b>. They put CO2          and Methane in the air . Okay, okay, cows make Methane          too. But these are causes that are <b>not natural</b>. CO2 and Methane keep sunlight in the earth. Which heat all three: air, water, and land. Droughts become harsher and storms become fiercer. We need to do something, and now.</p>
        <h3>Heating Masses Lead To Fiercer Storms: How?</h3>
        <p>The more hot the water, the more it evaporates. It evaporates high and a lot of water makes big clouds. Big clouds are obiously fiercer. and with less water on land, droughts can happen before it pours.</p>

        <h2 id = "etologists">Help the Earth</h2>
        <p>How do we help the earth? Don't litter. Bike or walk over short distances, and turn off a light when leaving a room. If  something might emit CO2, try to stop it. Also, don't waste water or food and place recyleable things in a can labled "recycle" if there is one. Plastic and paper are recycleable.</p> <img src = "https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/food/grapes.png">
